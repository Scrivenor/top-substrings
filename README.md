# Sub Strings
This Ruby method searches a string parameter and counts occurrences of words from a dictionary parameter

#### Parameters
(String, Array)

#### Returns
Hash

## Problems
Create a method that accepts a string and a dictionary array, then counts each occurrence of every word of the dictionary in the passed string

## What I used
Ruby arrays, hashes, and string methods

## What I learned / Problems I encountered and resolved
- How to iterate over an array, create a hash, and modify a hash
- Learned how to use a (very) little regex
- Initially I tried to loop over the include? method but realized it would never give me a count > 1.
